00:47.960 --> 00:52.840
<i>Once upon a time there
was a lovely princess.</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:56.680
<i>But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort...</i>

00:56.760 --> 01:01.640
<i>which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.</i>

01:01.720 --> 01:04.060
<i>She was locked away
in a castle...</i>

01:04.140 --> 01:08.360
<i>guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.</i>

01:08.440 --> 01:12.820
<i>Many brave knights had attempted to
free her from this dreadful prison,</i>

01:12.900 --> 01:15.650
<i>but none prevailed.</i>

01:15.740 --> 01:17.910
<i>She waited in the
dragon's keep...</i>

01:17.990 --> 01:20.910
<i>in the highest room of
the tallest tower...</i>

01:20.990 --> 01:25.540
<i>for her true love and
true love's first kiss.</i>

01:25.620 --> 01:28.580
(LAUGHING) Like that's
ever gonna happen.

01:28.670 --> 01:32.420
- (PAPER RUSTLING, TOILET FLUSHES)
- What a load of...

01:32.500 --> 01:37.090
Somebody once told me the
world is gonna roll me

01:37.180 --> 01:41.140
I am not the sharpest
tool in the shed.

01:41.220 --> 01:46.140
She was looking kind of dumb
with her finger and her thumb.

01:46.230 --> 01:49.940
In the shape of an
I on her forehead.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.940
The years start coming and
they don't stop coming.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.860
Fed to the rules and I
hit the ground running.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.200
Didn't make sense not
to live for fun.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.490
Your brain gets smart but
your head gets dumb.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.490
So much to do So much to see.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.160
So what's wrong with
taking the backstreets.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.290
You'll never know
if you don't go.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.830
You'll never shine
if you don't glow.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.840
Hey, now You're an all-star.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.300
Get your game on, go play.

02:14.380 --> 02:18.300
Hey, now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid.

02:18.380 --> 02:22.350
And all that glitters is gold.

02:22.430 --> 02:27.850
Only shooting stars
break the mould.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.940
It's a cool place and
they say it gets colder.

02:30.020 --> 02:32.190
You're bundled up now but
wait till you get older.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.400
But the meteor men
beg to differ.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.400
Judging by the hole in
the satellite picture.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.200
The ice we skate is
getting pretty thin.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.319
The water's getting warm
so you might as well swim.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.240
My world's on fire
How about yours.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.990
That's the way I like it
and I'll never get bored.

03:37.630 --> 03:40.880
- Think it's in there?
- AI right. Let's get it!

03:40.970 --> 03:43.720
Whoa. Ho ID on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.760
Yeah, it'll grind your
bones for its bread.

03:46.850 --> 03:50.810
(LAUGHS) Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

03:50.890 --> 03:54.940
Now, ogres...
They're much worse.

03:55.020 --> 03:57.940
They'll make a suit from
your freshly peeled skin.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.110
- No!
- They'll shave your liver.

04:00.190 --> 04:03.450
Squeeze the jelly
from your eyes!

04:03.530 --> 04:06.070
- Actually, it's quite good on toast.
- Back! Back, beast!

04:06.160 --> 04:08.290
Back! I warn ya!

Wanted. Fairy tale creatures.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.330
(SIGHS)

04:54.210 --> 04:56.670
(MAN'S VOICE) All right.
This one's full.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.380
- Take it away!
- (GASPS)

04:59.460 --> 05:03.340
- Move it along. Come on! Get up!
- Next!

05:03.420 --> 05:06.340
Give me that! Your
flying days are over.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.050
That's 20 pieces of silver

05:16.980 --> 05:19.860
This cage is too small.

05:19.940 --> 05:22.060
Please don't turn me in. I'll
never be stubborn again.

05:22.110 --> 05:24.110
I can change. Please!
Give me another chance!

05:24.190 --> 05:26.570
- Oh, shut up. Oh!
- Next!

05:26.660 --> 05:29.530
- What have you got?
- This little wooden puppet.

05:29.620 --> 05:34.540
I'm not a puppet.
I'm a real boy.

05:34.620 --> 05:37.000
Five shillings for
the possessed toy.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.170
- Take it away.
- Father, please! Don't let them do this!

05:39.250 --> 05:41.170
- Help me!
- Next. What have you got?

05:41.250 --> 05:43.880
- Well, I've got a talking donkey.
- (GRUNTS)

05:43.960 --> 05:48.510
Right. Well, that's good for ten
shillings, if you can prove it.

05:48.590 --> 05:52.510
Oh, go ahead, little fella.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.520
Well?

05:54.600 --> 05:57.310
Oh, oh, he's just... He's
just a little nervous.

05:57.390 --> 06:01.360
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you bone headed dolt...

06:01.440 --> 06:04.030
- That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
- No, no, he talks!

06:04.110 --> 06:08.240
He does. I can talk.
I love to talk.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.240
I'm the talkingest damn
thing you ever saw.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.870
- Get her out of my sight.
- No, no!

06:13.950 --> 06:18.370
I swear! Oh! He can talk!

06:18.460 --> 06:20.630
(GASPS)

06:20.710 --> 06:23.090
Hey! I can fly!

06:23.170 --> 06:24.800
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

06:24.880 --> 06:27.930
- He can talk!
- Ha, ha! That's right, fool!

06:28.010 --> 06:30.260
Now I'm a flying,
talking donkey.

06:30.340 --> 06:32.970
You might have seen a house
fly, maybe even a super fly,

06:33.060 --> 06:36.100
but I bet you are not
never seen a donkey fly.

06:36.180 --> 06:38.100
Ha, ha!

06:38.190 --> 06:40.100
Uh-oh.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.400
(GRUNTS)

06:42.480 --> 06:44.440
Seize him!

06:46.400 --> 06:49.240
After him! He's getting away!

06:54.580 --> 06:57.000
(GRUNTS, GASPS)

06:57.080 --> 07:00.290
(MAN) Get him! This way! Turn!

07:05.500 --> 07:07.800
You there. Ogre!

07:07.880 --> 07:10.180
Aye?

07:10.260 --> 07:12.293
By the order of
Lord Farquaad, I am

07:12.306 --> 07:14.350
authorised to place you
both under arrest...

07:14.430 --> 07:20.020
and transport you to a designated...
resettlement facility.

07:20.100 --> 07:24.150
Oh, really? You and what army?

07:27.570 --> 07:29.150
(GASPS, WHIMPERING)

07:29.240 --> 07:31.150
(CHUCKLES)

07:34.910 --> 07:36.910
Can I say something to you?

07:36.990 --> 07:40.330
Listen, you was really, really
something back there. Incredible!

07:40.410 --> 07:46.170
Are you talking to...
me? Whoa!

07:46.250 --> 07:48.223
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I tell you

07:48.236 --> 07:50.220
that you was great back there?
Those guards!

07:50.300 --> 07:53.010
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

07:53.090 --> 07:55.050
They was tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.060
That really made me
feel good to see that.

07:57.140 --> 08:00.180
- Oh, that's great. Really.
- Man, it's good to be free.

08:00.270 --> 08:05.810
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

08:05.900 --> 08:09.190
But, uh, I don't
have any friends.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.950
And I'm not going out
there by myself.

08:12.030 --> 08:14.570
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.580
You're a mean, green,
fighting machine.

08:16.660 --> 08:19.060
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

08:20.330 --> 08:23.170
(ROARING)

08:23.250 --> 08:25.920
Oh, wow! That was
really scary.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.843
If you don't mind me saying,
if that don't work,

08:27.856 --> 08:29.710
your breath certainly
will get the job done,

08:29.800 --> 08:33.009
'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs
or something, 'cause your breath stinks!

08:33.010 --> 08:36.220
You almost burned the
hair outta my nose,

08:36.300 --> 08:39.140
just like the time...
(MUMBLING)

08:39.220 --> 08:42.940
Then I ate some rotten berries. I had
strong gases eking out of my butt that day.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.730
Why are you following me?

08:46.860 --> 08:49.400
I'll tell you why.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.400
'Cause I'm all alone.

08:52.490 --> 08:56.240
There's no one here beside me.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.990
My problems have all gone.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.410
There's no one to deride me.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.460
But you gotta have friends...

09:05.540 --> 09:08.590
Stop singing!

09:08.670 --> 09:10.710
It's no wonder you don't
have any friends.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.420
Wow. Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

09:14.510 --> 09:18.600
Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me.
What am I?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.600
Uh...

09:23.480 --> 09:26.730
- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

09:26.810 --> 09:30.020
You know. Grab your
torch and pitchforks.

09:30.110 --> 09:32.110
Doesn't that bother you?

09:32.190 --> 09:34.320
Nope.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.280
- Really?
- Really, really.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.490
- Oh.
- Man, I like you. What's your name?

09:40.580 --> 09:44.250
Uh, Shrek.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.580
Shrek? Well, you know what
I like about you, Shrek?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.678
You got that kind of.

09:49.691 --> 09:51.710
I-don't-care-what-nobody... thinks-of-me
thing.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.590
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

09:55.670 --> 09:59.680
Wooh! Look at that. Who'd want
to live in a place like that?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.970
That would be my home.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.930
Oh! And it is lovely!
Just beautiful.

10:06.020 --> 10:09.810
You are quite a decorator. It's amazing
what you've done with such a modest budget.

10:09.900 --> 10:14.650
I like that Boulder.
That is a nice Boulder.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.120
I guess you don't
entertain much, do you?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.990
I like my privacy.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.660
You know, I do too. That's
another thing we have in common.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.000
Like, I hate it when you
got somebody in your face.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.028
You're trying to give them a
hint, and they won't leave.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.000
There's that awkward silence.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.840
- Can I stay with you?
- Uh, what?

10:37.930 --> 10:40.510
Can I stay with you, please?

10:40.590 --> 10:42.890
- Of course!
- Really?

10:42.970 --> 10:45.350
- No.
- Please! I don't wanna go back there!

10:45.430 --> 10:49.350
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.020
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

10:52.110 --> 10:55.230
- Please! Please!
- Okay! Okay!

10:55.320 --> 10:57.900
- But one night only.
- Ah! Thank you!

10:57.990 --> 11:00.320
- What are you... No! No!
- This is gonna be fun!

11:00.410 --> 11:02.320
We can stay up late,
swapping manly stories,

11:02.410 --> 11:05.200
and in the morning
I'm making waffles.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.540
- Oh!
- Where do, uh, I sleep?

11:08.620 --> 11:10.370
Outside!

11:10.460 --> 11:13.540
Oh, well, I guess that's cool.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.710
I mean, I don't know you,
and you don't know me,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.170
so I guess outside
is best, you know.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.260
(SNIFFLES) Here I go.

11:23.430 --> 11:27.520
Good night. (SIGHS)

11:27.600 --> 11:29.588
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.600
I was born outside.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.360
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.730
By myself, outside.

11:36.820 --> 11:41.610
I'm all alone There's
no one here beside me.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.030

12:00.840 --> 12:03.260
(SIGHS)

12:43.800 --> 12:45.800
(CREAKING)

12:45.890 --> 12:48.510
(SIGHS) I thought I told
you to stay outside.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.270
- I am outside.
- (CLATTERING)

12:52.350 --> 12:54.100
(CLATTERING)

12:57.770 --> 13:01.570
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the
farm, but what choice do we have?

13:01.650 --> 13:04.150
It's not home, but
it'll do just fine.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.160
What a lovely bed.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.580
- Got ya.
- (SNIFFS) I found some cheese.

13:08.660 --> 13:11.160
- Ow! (GRUNTS)
- Blah! Awful stuff.

13:12.910 --> 13:15.500
- Is that you, Gorder?
- How did you know?

13:15.580 --> 13:18.500
Enough! What are you
doing in my house?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.500
(GRUNTS) Hey!

13:20.590 --> 13:23.220
- (SNICKERS)
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.083
Dead broad off the table.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.890
Where are we supposed to put her?
The bed's taken.

13:26.970 --> 13:30.140
Huh? (GASPS)

Although she lives with seven
other men, she's not easy.

And last, but
certainly not least,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.890
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

19:04.970 --> 19:07.520
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

19:07.600 --> 19:09.650
But don't let that cool you off.

find someone who can go...

What kind of quest?

26:19.620 --> 26:21.950
(DONKEY) Let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon...

26:22.040 --> 26:24.749
and rescue a princess just so Farquaad
will give you back a swamp...

26:24.750 --> 26:27.959
which you only don't have because he filled
it full of freaks in the first place.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.118
Is that about right?

26:30.131 --> 26:32.300
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

26:32.380 --> 26:35.920
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

26:36.010 --> 26:37.930
Throttle him, lay siege
to his fortress,

26:38.010 --> 26:40.850
grind his bones to make your
bread, the whole ogre trip.

26:40.930 --> 26:42.850
Oh, I know what.

26:42.930 --> 26:45.140
Maybe I could have decapitated
an entire village...

26:45.230 --> 26:47.350
and put their heads on a pike,

26:47.440 --> 26:51.060
gotten a knife, cut open their
spleen and drink their fluids.

26:51.150 --> 26:53.280
Does that sound good to you?

26:53.360 --> 26:55.990
Uh, no, not really, no.

26:56.070 --> 26:59.870
For your information, there's a lot
more to ogres than people think.

26:59.950 --> 27:02.700
- Example?
- Example?

27:02.780 --> 27:08.920
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
- (SNIFFS) They stink?

27:09.000 --> 27:11.290
- Yes... No!
- They make you cry? - No!

27:11.380 --> 27:14.800
You leave them out in the sun, they get all
brown, start sprouting little white hairs.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.880
No! Layers!

27:16.970 --> 27:19.300
Onions have layers.

27:19.380 --> 27:22.680
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.180
You get it? We both have layers.
(SIGHS)

27:27.100 --> 27:30.690
Oh, you both have layers. Oh.

27:30.770 --> 27:34.150
(SNIFFS) You know, not
everybody likes onions.

27:34.230 --> 27:36.860
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

27:36.940 --> 27:40.860
I don't care... what
everyone likes.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.660
Ogres are not like cakes.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.870
You know what else everybody likes?
Parfaits.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.880
Have you ever met a person, you
say, Let's get some parfait,

27:51.960 --> 27:53.880
they say, No, I don't
like no parfait?

27:53.960 --> 27:56.710
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

27:56.800 --> 27:59.550
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

27:59.630 --> 28:02.550
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.600
Bye-bye. See ya later.

28:08.430 --> 28:12.860
Parfaits may be the most delicious
thing on the whole damn planet.

28:12.940 --> 28:15.150
You know, I think I
preferred your humming.

28:15.230 --> 28:17.900
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.900
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

28:25.330 --> 28:31.210
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

28:31.290 --> 28:33.790
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh

28:33.880 --> 28:39.340
I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today.

28:39.420 --> 28:41.880
Uh-huh, uh-huh Uh-huh, uh-huh.

28:41.970 --> 28:45.890
And everything that you
receive up yonder.

28:45.970 --> 28:49.890
Is what you give to
me the day I wander

28:49.980 --> 28:52.940
I'm on my way

28:54.020 --> 28:56.940
I'm on my way

28:58.030 --> 29:00.110
I'm on my way.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.650
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that?

29:02.740 --> 29:06.530
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

29:06.620 --> 29:10.330
Believe me, Donkey, if it
was me, you'd be dead.

29:10.410 --> 29:13.170
(SNIFFS) It's brimstone.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.420
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.533
Don't be talking about
it's the brimstone. I

29:18.546 --> 29:20.590
know what I smell. It
wasn't no brimstone.

29:20.670 --> 29:22.630
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

29:25.550 --> 29:27.760
(RUMBLING)

29:40.650 --> 29:43.990
Sure, it's big enough, but
look at the location.

29:44.070 --> 29:47.030
(LAUGHING)

29:47.120 --> 29:51.830
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

29:51.910 --> 29:53.830
Oh, aye.

29:53.910 --> 29:57.500
Well, I have a bit of
a confession to make.

29:57.580 --> 30:00.960
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our
fear right out there on our sleeves.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.078
Wait a second. Donkeys
don't have sleeves.

30:03.091 --> 30:05.130
You know what I mean.

30:05.220 --> 30:07.890
You can't tell me you're
afraid of heights.

30:07.970 --> 30:10.253
I'm just a little
uncomfortable about being on

30:10.266 --> 30:12.560
a rickety bridge over a
boiling lake of lava!

30:12.640 --> 30:16.690
Come on, Donkey. I'm right
here beside ya, okay?

30:16.770 --> 30:19.440
For emotional support,

30:19.520 --> 30:24.070
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

30:24.150 --> 30:26.070
- Really?
- Really, really.

30:26.150 --> 30:29.370
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

30:29.450 --> 30:34.040
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.500
Don't look down. Keep on moving.
Don't look down.

30:37.580 --> 30:41.380
(GASPS) Shrek! I'm
looking down!

30:41.460 --> 30:44.380
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

30:44.460 --> 30:48.010
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

30:48.090 --> 30:50.890
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

30:50.970 --> 30:53.390
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey...

30:53.470 --> 30:56.560
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

30:56.640 --> 31:00.520
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

31:00.610 --> 31:03.690
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

31:03.780 --> 31:07.200
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.570
(SCREAMS) No, Shrek!

31:09.660 --> 31:12.780
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doing it.

31:12.870 --> 31:17.120
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

31:17.210 --> 31:19.710
Oh!

31:19.790 --> 31:23.800
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

31:27.170 --> 31:29.430
Cool.

31:29.510 --> 31:32.260
(DONKEY) So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

31:32.350 --> 31:36.100
Inside, waiting for
us to rescue her.

31:36.180 --> 31:39.100
(CHUCKLES) I was talking
about the dragon, Shrek.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.440
(WATER DRIPPING)

31:44.110 --> 31:46.030
(WIND HOWLING)

31:54.580 --> 31:56.500
(DONKEY WHISPERING)
You afraid?

31:56.580 --> 31:59.870
No, but... Shh.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.500
Oh, good. Me neither. (GASPS)

32:03.590 --> 32:06.960
'Cause there's nothing
wrong with being afraid.

32:07.050 --> 32:10.300
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

32:10.380 --> 32:12.430
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

32:12.510 --> 32:15.219
With a dragon that breathes fire and
eats knights and breathes fire,

32:15.220 --> 32:18.680
it sure doesn't mean you're a
coward if you're a little scared.

32:18.770 --> 32:22.770
I sure as heck am not a coward.
I know that. (GASPS)

32:22.860 --> 32:26.190
Donkey, two things, okay?

32:26.280 --> 32:28.820
Shut... up.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.660
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.370
Stairs? I thought we was
looking for the princess.

32:34.450 --> 32:39.330
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

32:39.410 --> 32:43.000
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

32:43.080 --> 32:47.000
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.130
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.180
Those stairs won't know
which way they're going.

32:52.260 --> 32:54.680
(CREAKING)

32:56.680 --> 32:58.640
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.520
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

33:01.600 --> 33:06.190
I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a
step right here. I'd step all over it.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.700
Well, at least we know where the
princess is, but where's the...

33:12.780 --> 33:17.030
Dragon! (SCREAMS)

33:18.120 --> 33:20.040
(GASPS)

33:25.420 --> 33:27.090
(ROARS)

33:30.630 --> 33:32.880
Donkey, look out! (SCREAMS)

33:34.090 --> 33:38.060
(SCREAMS)

33:40.520 --> 33:42.230
(WHIMPERING)

33:44.520 --> 33:46.520
- Got ya!
- (ROARS)

33:46.610 --> 33:49.690
(GASPS)

33:49.780 --> 33:55.030
(SHOUTS) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

33:55.110 --> 33:58.080
(SCREAMING)

34:06.290 --> 34:08.920
(GASPS)

34:09.000 --> 34:13.630
Oh! Aah! Aah!

34:13.720 --> 34:17.220
(GASPING)

34:18.430 --> 34:22.220
(GROWLS)

34:22.310 --> 34:25.730
No. Oh, no. No! (SCREAMS)

34:25.810 --> 34:29.440
- Oh, what large teeth you have.
- (GROWLS)

34:29.520 --> 34:31.428
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you

34:31.441 --> 34:33.360
probably hear this all
the time from your food,

34:33.440 --> 34:37.570
but you must bleach, 'cause that is
one dazzling smile you got there.

34:37.660 --> 34:40.160
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

34:40.240 --> 34:45.000
And you know what else? You're...
You're a girl dragon!

34:45.080 --> 34:49.590
Oh, sure! I mean, of course
you're a girl dragon.

34:49.670 --> 34:53.460
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.880
What's the matter with you? You
got something in your eye?

34:55.970 --> 34:58.800
Ooh. Oh. Oh.

34:58.890 --> 35:01.389
Man, I'd really love to stay, but,
you know, I'm, uh... (COUGHS)

35:01.390 --> 35:05.350
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.350
Shrek! (GASPS)

35:07.440 --> 35:11.150
(WHIMPERING) No! Shrek! Shrek!

35:11.230 --> 35:13.150
Shrek!

35:13.780 --> 35:17.030
(GROANS, SIGHS)

35:17.110 --> 35:20.320
(CHORUS VOCALISING)

35:24.790 --> 35:29.000
(VOCALISING CONTINUES)

35:41.800 --> 35:44.350
(VOCALISING CONTINUES)

35:44.430 --> 35:45.850
Oh! Oh!

35:45.930 --> 35:47.850
- Wake up!
- What?

35:47.940 --> 35:49.560
Are you Princess Fiona?

35:49.650 --> 35:54.980
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.070
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

35:57.150 --> 35:59.150
But wait, Sir Knight.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.530
This be-ith our first meeting.

36:01.620 --> 36:05.330
Should it not be a
wonderful, romantic moment?

36:05.410 --> 36:09.750
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

36:09.830 --> 36:11.920
You should sweep
me off my feet...

36:12.000 --> 36:15.380
out yonder window and down a
rope on to your Valiant steed.

36:15.460 --> 36:18.260
You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

36:18.340 --> 36:22.590
Mm-hmm. (SCREAMS, GRUNTS)

36:22.680 --> 36:25.560
But we have to
savour this moment!

36:25.640 --> 36:28.390
You could recite an
epic poem for me.

36:28.480 --> 36:30.940
A ballad? A sonnet!

36:31.020 --> 36:34.270
- A Limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

36:34.360 --> 36:38.780
Can I at least know the
name of my champion?

36:38.860 --> 36:40.780
Um, Shrek.

36:40.860 --> 36:44.580
Sir Shrek. (CLEARS THROAT)

36:44.660 --> 36:49.410
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.540
Thanks!

36:54.290 --> 36:56.460
(ROARING)

36:56.550 --> 36:58.380
You didn't slay the dragon?

36:58.460 --> 37:00.920
- It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
- (SCREAMS)

37:01.010 --> 37:03.590
But this isn't right!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.930
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

37:06.010 --> 37:08.100
That's what all the
other knights did.

37:08.180 --> 37:10.480
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

37:10.560 --> 37:14.100
That's not the point. Oh!

37:14.190 --> 37:16.650
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.780
Well, I have to save my ass.

37:18.860 --> 37:22.070
What kind of knight are you?

37:22.150 --> 37:24.570
One of a kind.

37:24.660 --> 37:27.030
(DONKEY) Slowdown.
Slowdown, baby, please.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.330
I believe it's healthy to get to know
someone over a long period of time.

37:31.410 --> 37:34.000
Just call me old-fashioned.
(LAUGHS)

37:34.080 --> 37:37.590
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

37:37.670 --> 37:41.130
I'm not emotionally ready for
a commitment of, uh, this...

37:41.220 --> 37:43.510
Magnitude really is the
word I'm looking for.

37:43.590 --> 37:47.100
Magnitude... Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

37:47.180 --> 37:49.640
Hey, what are you doing?

37:49.720 --> 37:52.980
Okay, okay. Let's just backup a little
and take this one step a ta time.

37:53.060 --> 37:57.190
We really should get to know each
other first as friends or pen pals.

37:57.270 --> 38:01.490
I'm on theroada lot, but I
just love receiving cards...

38:01.570 --> 38:03.990
I'd really love
to stay, but...

38:04.070 --> 38:06.660
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.438
You're gonna tear it off. I
don't give permission...

38:08.451 --> 38:10.160
What are you gonna do with that?

38:10.240 --> 38:14.040
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

38:14.120 --> 38:16.880
No, no! No. No, no, no!
No! Oh!

- Hi, Princess!
- It talks!

38:45.780 --> 38:49.530
Yeah, it's getting him to
shut up that's the trick.

Okay, you two,
head for the exit!

You're wonderful. You're...

(SIGHS) Princess, I was sent to
rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

42:47.310 --> 42:49.230
He's the one who
wants to marry you.

42:49.310 --> 42:51.230
Then why didn't he
come rescue me?

42:51.320 --> 42:55.650
Good question. You should ask
him that when we get there.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.780
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

42:58.870 --> 43:01.620
not by some ogre and his...
his pet.

my job any easier.

43:06.540 --> 43:09.920
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

43:10.000 --> 43:15.260
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if
he wants to rescue me properly,

43:15.340 --> 43:17.680
I'll be waiting for
him right here.

43:17.760 --> 43:22.810

I'm a delivery boy.

43:22.890 --> 43:25.140

- Ya coming, Donkey?

43:27.310 --> 43:29.270
I'm right behind ya.

Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

This is not dignified! Put me down!

43:37.610 --> 43:40.490
Okay, so here's
another question.

43:40.570 --> 43:43.620
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,
but you don't really like her that way.

43:43.700 --> 43:46.159
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

43:46.160 --> 43:48.670
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

43:48.750 --> 43:51.500
You just tell her she's
not your true love.

43:51.590 --> 43:54.300
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

The sooner we get to

43:59.430 --> 44:02.350
You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!

44:02.430 --> 44:06.180
And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?
What's he like?

44:06.270 --> 44:08.390
Let me put it this
way, Princess.

44:08.480 --> 44:12.480
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.480

You're just jealous you can never measure
up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

44:28.790 --> 44:31.710
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

44:31.790 --> 44:35.090
But I'll let you do the measuring
when you see him tomorrow.

44:35.170 --> 44:39.380

- No, that'll take longer.

- But there's robbers in the woods.

is starting to sound good.

we're going to see in this forest.

fit for a princess.

needs a few homey touches.

There's just me and my swamp.

a ten-foot wall around my land.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.100
You cut me deep, Shrek.

just a way to keep somebody out.

Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on now.

53:27.240 --> 53:29.250

- What?

53:29.330 --> 53:32.210
That! Back there.
That was amazing!

53:32.290 --> 53:34.210
Where did you learn that?

53:34.290 --> 53:37.420
Well... (CHUCKLES)
When one lives alone,

53:37.500 --> 53:40.260
uh, one has to learn these
things in case there's a...

53:40.340 --> 53:42.970
- There's an arrow in your butt!
- What?

53:43.050 --> 53:46.850
- Oh, would you look at that?
- Oh, no. This is all my fault.

53:46.930 --> 53:48.850
- I'm so sorry.
- Why? What's wrong?

53:48.930 --> 53:50.588
Shrek's hurt.

53:50.601 --> 53:52.270
Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die.

53:52.350 --> 53:54.238
Donkey, I'm okay.

53:54.251 --> 53:56.150
You can't do this to me. I'm
too young for you to die.

Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.450
- Does anyone know the Heimlich?
- Donkey! Calm down.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.833
If you want to help
Shrek, run into the woods

54:03.846 --> 54:06.160
and find me a blue
flower with red thorns.

54:06.240 --> 54:09.830
Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it.
Blue flower, red thorns.

54:09.910 --> 54:13.370
Don't die, Shrek. If you see a long
tunnel, stay away from the light!

54:13.460 --> 54:16.630
- (BOTH) Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

54:16.710 --> 54:19.000
- Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?

54:19.090 --> 54:21.300
- For getting rid of Donkey.
- Ah.

54:21.380 --> 54:23.760
Now you hold still, and
I'll yank this thing out.

54:23.840 --> 54:26.050
Ow! Hey! Easy
with the yanking.

54:26.140 --> 54:28.760
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
- No, it's tender.

54:28.850 --> 54:30.600
Now, hold on.

54:30.680 --> 54:31.713
What you're doing is
the opposite of help.

54:31.726 --> 54:32.770
Don't move.

do you propose we do?

Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

54:41.506 --> 54:42.860
Blue flower, red thorns.

54:42.950 --> 54:45.320
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colour-blind!

Nothing happened.
We were just, uh...

55:06.970 --> 55:09.680
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

55:09.760 --> 55:13.020
Oh, come on! That's the
last thing on my mind.

55:13.100 --> 55:16.770

56:06.240 --> 56:10.740
That comes between me
and the awful sting.

56:10.820 --> 56:15.910
That comes from living in a
world that's so damn mean.

- That's DuLoc?
- Yeah, I know.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.550
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

57:05.630 --> 57:08.130
which I think means he
has a really... Ow!

Um, I, uh...

57:10.220 --> 57:12.640

- Sure.

57:12.720 --> 57:14.810
But, Shrek?

57:14.890 --> 57:17.680
- I'm... I'm worried about Donkey.

- I mean, look at him.

57:20.230 --> 57:23.230
- He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

57:23.310 --> 57:28.320
That's what they always say, and then
next thing you know, you're on your back.

57:28.400 --> 57:30.860
- Dead.
- You know, she's right.

57:30.950 --> 57:33.820
You look awful. Do you
want to sit down?

57:33.910 --> 57:36.620
- I'll make you some tea.
- I didn't want to say nothing,

57:36.700 --> 57:39.450

when I turn my head like this, look.

great in stews.

I could feel it.

don't marry Farquaad?

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.120
- That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.
- (GASPS)

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.620
My only chance to live happily ever
after is to marry my truelove.

- (DEEP SIGH)
- Don't you see, Donkey?

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:42.500
That's just how it has to be.

01:04:42.590 --> 01:04:45.630
It's the only way
to break the spell.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:48.470
- You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:51.470
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:53.680
What's the point of being able to
talk if you gotta keep secrets?

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.890
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:00.060
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:03.150
I just know before this is over, I'm gonna
need a whole lot of serious therapy.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:06.780
- Look at my eye twitching.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:29.380
(SNORING)

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:33.220
(FIONA) I tell him,
I tell him not.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.680
I tell him, I tell him not.

01:05:37.770 --> 01:05:39.690
I tell him.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:41.850
Shrek!

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:44.480
Shrek, there's
something I want...

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.570
(SNORING)

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:07.500
Shrek.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.970
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:13.010
Never been better.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:16.390
I... I don't... There's
something I have to tell you.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.020
You don't have to tell
me anything, Princess.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.190
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:23.190
Every word.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:25.440
I thought you'd understand.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.440
Oh, I understand.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.110
Like you said, Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.860
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:35.700
Yeah? Well, it does.

you a little something.

(YAWNS) What'd I miss?
What'd I miss?

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.260
(MUFFLED) Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:58.100
Princess Fiona.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.890
As promised. Now hand it over.

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:05.230
Very well, ogre. The deed to your
swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.860
Take it and go before
I change my mind.

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:12.780
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.780
but you startled me,

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:18.530
for I have never seen such
a radiant beauty before.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:21.620
I am Lord Farquaad.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.580
Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no.

(SNAPS FINGERS)

01:07:27.151 --> 01:07:28.630
Forgive me, my Lord, for
I was just saying...

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:34.170
a short... farewell.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.890
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.890
It's not like it has feelings.

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:44.940
No, you're right. It doesn't.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.020
Princess Fiona, beautiful,
fair, flawless Fiona.

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:52.110
- I ask your hand in marriage.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:57.240
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:05.710
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.960
Excellent! I'll start the
plans, for tomorrow we wed!

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.960
No! I mean, uh,

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.420
why wait?

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:17.340
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:20.140
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:24.140
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:26.560
There's the caterer, the cake,
the band, the guest list.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.650
Captain, round up some guests!

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:32.440
(FIONA) Fare-thee-well, ogre.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.110
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:36.539
Yeah? So what?

01:08:36.552 --> 01:08:37.911
Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.410
Look, I talked to her last night.
She's...

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:44.540
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.370
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

01:08:48.460 --> 01:08:50.420
Shrek, I... I wanna
go with you.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.460
I told you, didn't I? You're
not coming home with me.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:57.510
I live alone! My swamp!
Me! Nobody else!

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:59.680
Understand? Nobody!

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:04.600
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.850
- But I thought...
- Yeah. You know what?

01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:10.150
You thought wrong!

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.820
Shrek.

01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:23.620
I heard there was
a secret chord.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.750
That David played and
it pleased the Lord.

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:31.670
But you don't really
care for music, do ya.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:36.760
It goes like this the
fourth, the fifth.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.380
The minor fall the major lift.

Baby, I've been here before

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:10.410
I know this room I've
walked this floor

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:15.590
I used to live alone
before I knew you

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.380
I've seen your flag
on the marble arch.

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:23.800
But love is not a
victory march.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:28.310
It's a cold and it's
a broken hallelujah.

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.060
Hallelujah.

And all I ever
learned from love

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:53.040

who's seen the light.

- (GRUNTS)
- What are you doing?

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.630
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:43.630
Well, yeah.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:47.090
But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.970
It is around your half. See, that's
your half, and this is my half.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:52.640
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.270
Yes, my half. I helped
rescue the princess.

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:57.600
I did half the work, I
get half the Booty.

01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:01.020
Now hand me that big old rock, the
one that looks like your head.

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.440
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.530
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:07.530
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

Fine!

not through with you yet.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:15.290
Well, I'm through with you.

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:18.630
Uh-uh. You know, with you
it's always, Me, me, me!

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.300
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.510
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:25.550
You are mean to me.

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:28.140
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.310
You're always pushing me
around or pushing me away.

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:35.230
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.520
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

Oh, yeah. You're
right, Donkey.

stabbing me in the back!

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.160
- Go away! - There you are, doing it
again just like you did to Fiona.

you, maybe even love you.

Love me? She said I was
ugly, a hideous creature.

I heard the two
of you talking.

She wasn't talking about you.

01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:08.470
She was talking about,
uh, somebody else.

She wasn't talking about me?

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:15.810
Well, then who was
she talking about?

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:18.689
Uh-uh, no way. I am not saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

- No!
- Okay, look.

(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.460

big, stupid, ugly ogre.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:41.630
Can you forgive me?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.750
Hey, that's what friends
are for, right?

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.510
Right. Friends?

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.510
Friends.

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:53.550
So, um,

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:55.890
what did Fiona say about me?

01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:59.100
What are you asking me for? Why
don't you just go ask her?

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.190
The wedding! We'll
never make it in time.

01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:05.480

there's a will, there's a way,

- of our new king...
- Excuse me.

- Could we just skip ahead to the I do's?
- (CHUCKLING)

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.720
Go on.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:26.400
Go ahead, have some fun. If we need
you, I'll whistle. How about that?

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:30.940
Shrek, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:33.700
- You wanna do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.700
There's a line you
gotta wait for.

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:38.280
The preacher's gonna say, Speak
now or forever hold your peace.

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:42.120
- That's when you say, I object!
- I don't have time for this!

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.910
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.920
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.290
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:49.590
- Please her?
- Yes!

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.300
Then you got to, got to
try a little tenderness.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.130
- The chicks love that romantic crap!
- All right! Cut it out.

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.850
- When does this guy say the line?
- We gotta check it out.

01:15:58.930 --> 01:16:02.100
- (DONKEY GRUNTING)
- And so, by the power vested in me,

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.440
- (SHREK) What do you see?
- The whole town's in there.

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:08.650
- I now pronounce you husband and wife,
- They're at the altar.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.280
- King and queen.
- Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

- Oh, for the love of Pete!

- Shrek?

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.450

Hi, everyone. Having
a good time, are ya?

I love DuLoc, first of all.

01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.960
- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:35.970
Really, it's rude enough being
alive when no one wants you,

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.390
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona!

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.470
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.520
It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.980
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:51.940
Because... Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:54.400
Outrageous! Fiona,
don't listen to him.

01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.110
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.570
Well, I... Uh...

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.040

Who cares? It's preposterous!

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:28.940
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss
away from our happily ever after.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.610
Now kiss me! Mmmm!

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:39.030

(FARQUAAD) Ugh!
It's disgusting!

01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:16.780

I order you to get that out
of my sight now! Get them!

- Get them both!
- No, no!

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.853
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
This

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.740
marriage is binding, and
that makes me king!

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:29.120
- See? See?
- No, let go of me! Shrek!

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.910
- No! - (FARQUAAD) Don't just
stand there, you morons.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.540
Get out of my way! Fiona!

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:38.710
Arrgh!

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.800
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.800
- You'll beg for death to save you!
- No! Shrek!

- And as for you, my wife,
- Fiona!

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:51.140
I'll have you locked back in that
tower for the rest of your days!

01:18:51.230 --> 01:18:53.060
- I am king!
- (WHISTLES)

But I don't understand.

I'm supposed to be beautiful.

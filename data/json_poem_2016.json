      "Documentation": "This poem was inspired by a conversation with a friend who was asking about my experience as an Asian person compared to other Asians. It's also an introspective piece on my own search for identity and the stereotypes that I've encountered. I've previously worked with JSON and it's as finicky as I remember. I actually had to ask my mom what generation I am -- and I still don't know which I identify as. In Japanese American culture, Issei are Japanese born who moved to America, and Nisei are the 2nd generation. I am either Sansei (3rd generation) or Go-sei (5th generation).",
